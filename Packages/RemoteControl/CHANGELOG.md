# Changelog

## [0.21.0] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

- Member access is now backed by source-generated accessors, removing the runtime dependency on `Unity.Properties` and reducing reflection overhead.
- `ExposedObject` is now a readonly struct and was renamed to `ExposedObjectHandle`, eliminating transient view allocations during property access.

### Fixed

- Static `[ExposedClass]` types no longer disappear from the exposed set when their static constructor runs before all game assemblies are loaded; attributes are re-scanned after assembly load.
- Inherited `[ExposedClass]` members are now registered in declaration order.

## [0.20.12] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- `switchSceneOnLoad` option for LiveScene loading, controlling whether loading a scene also switches to it.

## [0.20.11] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Log the live scene file path when a scene is saved.

## [0.20.10] - 2026-06-02

- No functional changes (version synchronized with the monorepo release).

## [0.20.9] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- `allowExternalConnections` option to bind the server to all network interfaces.

### Changed

- Handlers are now registered per-instance with their routes declared in the constructor.
