# Changelog

## [0.20.12] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- Eye gaze is now delegated to the VRM10 `LookAt` component, so the avatar's eyes follow the configured look-at target instead of being driven directly.

## [0.20.11] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- `ChildProcessQuitSignal`: signals a specific child process (keyed by its PID) to quit gracefully via a Windows named event, so a windowless child can run its own save-on-quit instead of being hard-killed.
- "Assets/Lilium Live Studio/Remove Missing Scripts" context-menu command that removes missing scripts from the selected prefab assets.

### Changed

- Stopping a windowless child process now signals it to quit and returns immediately without waiting for it to exit (`ChildProcessHost.RequestStopAndRelease`).

### Fixed

- The package Readme inspector buttons (language toggle, section actions, Install) are now clickable even when the package is consumed as an immutable git/registry dependency.

## [0.20.10] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- `WindowsFirewall` helper that registers inbound UDP allow rules via `netsh`. Rules are keyed by the listening port (not the program path), so a single rule survives the tool being relocated, reinstalled, or shipped from a different package-cache path. Elevation is requested only when the rule is missing.

## [0.20.9] - 2026-06-02

### Changed

- RemoteControl handlers are now registered per-instance with their routes declared in the constructor.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Initial release. Split out from `jp.lilium.virgo.studio` to separate VTuber-app generic infrastructure (Camera / Lighting / Scene / Build / RemoteControl base / shared Localization) from VirgoMotion-specific motion reception and avatar control.
